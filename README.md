# Vulnerability Management

## Objective

A comprehensive vulnerability management project aimed at identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities for a client. Involving regular scanning, detailed analysis, and vulnerability prioritization, as well as implementing remediation. Findings and remediation efforts documented to improve client security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using vulnerability scanning tools: Nessus.
- Evaluate the severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities, as well as prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk assessment criteria.
- Develop and implement remediation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.
- Create detailed reports on vulnerability findings and remediation.
- Effectually communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
- Understand system configurations and network architectures.
- Analyzing vulnerability scan results and investigating root causes of vulnerabilities while proposing effective solutions.
- Troubleshooting issues that arise as seen in the scan and subsequent research

### Tools Used

- Metasploit: To exploit vulnerabilities and validate remediation.
- Metasploitable: A deliberately vulnerable environment for testing.
- Nessus: To scan and identify vulnerabilities within the environment.

## Steps
1. After installing Nessus start a new scan and enter the name, a description, and your target (either a specific IP or a range/list of IP addresses in a file).<br>

  *Ref1: Vulnerability Scan*
2. When the scan completes check it's results. One can see the description of the vulnerabilities and a severity rating. Generate a report with the report button and choose "Complete list of vulberavilities by Host"<br>
  ![Generate report](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f99d1e6-f9f0-4954-918a-34bf5a48bbbc)<br>
  *Ref2: Vulnerability Report*
3. Once comfortable with the contents of the report, install and run metasploit (framework installed in Kali) and metasploitable in the same network as your machine running Nessus.<br>
  ![metasploit console](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66d90414-d22e-4678-a661-de68babe1b6c)<br>

   *Ref4:<a href="https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2/"> Metasploitable 2</a>*
4. For testing metasploit is used to run an exploit on the target system. In Kali Linux terminal spin up metasploit console with [msfconsole]. Using [search vsftpd] to search for the specific exploit, using the xploit with [use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor].       [show options] will show what is necessary to run the exploit. Set the host machine to the target with [set RHOST <ip of target>] and then enter [run] into the console.
5. Going to our machine running Nessus, run a new scan on the metasploitable vm.<br>

   *Ref5: Nessus Scan*
6. The scan results show the number of vulnerabilities, Severity rating, CVSS, VPR score, etc...<br>

7. Clicking on a single vulnerability gives more insight. Severity, Description, a Sloution, and other relevant information is displayed for further action. 66 vulnerabilities were identified fro the client on the target system.<br>

8. For a comprehensive report to aid in analysis and remediation click on the report button (as described above).<br>

### <ins>Analysis</ins><br>
  ![Apache critical 10 0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/279d70a1-bb34-47eb-982a-f6ecca67a770)<br>
  *Ref7: Apache CVSS 10.0*<br>
  Apache Tomcat SEoL (<=5.5.x) is an unsupported version of Apache Tomcat. The lack of support suggests that no new security patches for it will be released by the vendor. Meaning that any security vulnerabilities that exists in regards to this program may contain     security vulnerabilities. Having a CVSS of 10.0 means that this issue requires an immediate remediation. The solution to remediate is as simple as going to tomcat.apache.org and upgrading it to a more recent or supported version of tomcat.
  ![ISC BIND DOS High 8 6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/628b4c6f-f337-455e-8b50-63d058f517b2)<br>
  *Ref8: DoS vuln. 8.6*<br>
  Next vulnerability to highlight is the ISC BIND Service Downgrade / Reflected DoS, which affects the remote name server with Service Downgrade / Reflected DoS vulnerabilities. The affect of performance downgrade and Reflected DoS vulnerabilities is due to BIND DNS not adequately limiting the number fetches which may be performed while processing a refferal response. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this to cause degredation in the service of the recursive server or use the affected server as a reflector in a reflected attack. To remediate this issue upgrade the ISC BIND version from isc.org/download.
  ![SSL cert medium 6 5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7344be82-ad8c-4f32-8696-4833e518261a)<br>
  *Ref9: SSL cert 6.5*<br>
  SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted is a 6.5 medium severity vulnerability. The certificate is designated as untrusted as the server's X.509's certificate cannot be trusted. That is to say one of these three situations have broken the chain of trust.
