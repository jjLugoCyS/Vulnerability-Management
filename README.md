# Vulnerability Management

## Objective

A comprehensive vulnerability management project aimed at identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities for a client. Involving regular scanning, detailed analysis, and vulnerability prioritization, as well as implementing remediation. Findings and remediation efforts documented to improve client security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using vulnerability scanning tools: Nessus.
- Evaluate the severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities, as well as prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk assessment criteria.
- Develop and implement remediation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.
- Create detailed reports on vulnerability findings and remediation.
- Effectually communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
- Understand system configurations and network architectures.
- Analyzing vulnerability scan results and investigating root causes of vulnerabilities while proposing effective solutions.
- Troubleshooting issues that arise as seen in the scan and subsequent research

### Tools Used
<!--[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]-->

- Splunk: Utilized Splunk for real-time data indexing, search, and visualization, create indexes and detection of system activity and analyze security events.
- Sysmon (System Monitor): Implemented Sysmon to capture detailed system activity and integrated it with splunk, enhancing visibility into potential security incidents and system anomalies.
- Nmap: Leveraged Nmap for network scanning and enumeration, identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities to assess the security posture of systems and networks.
