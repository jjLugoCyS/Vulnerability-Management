# Vulnerability Management

## Objective

A comprehensive vulnerability management project aimed at identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities for a client. Involving regular scanning, detailed analysis, and vulnerability prioritization, as well as implementing remediation. Findings and remediation efforts documented to improve client security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using vulnerability scanning tools: Nessus.
- Evaluate the severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities, as well as prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk assessment criteria.
- Develop and implement remediation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.
- Create detailed reports on vulnerability findings and remediation.
- Effectually communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
- Understand system configurations and network architectures.
- Analyzing vulnerability scan results and investigating root causes of vulnerabilities while proposing effective solutions.
- Troubleshooting issues that arise as seen in the scan and subsequent research

### Tools Used

- Metasploit: To exploit vulnerabilities and validate remediation.
- Metasploitable: A deliberately vulnerable environment for testing.
- Nessus: To scan and identify vulnerabilities within the environment.

## Steps
1. After installing Nessus start a new scan and enter the name, a description, and your target (either a specific IP or a range/list of IP addresses in a file).<br>

2. When the scan completes check it's results. One can see the description of the vulnerabilities and a severity rating. Generate a report with the report button and choose "Complete list of vulberavilities by Host"<br>

3. Once comfortable with the contents of the report, install and run metasploit (framework installed in Kali) and metasploitable in the same network as your machine running Nessus.<br>

4. For testing metasploit is used to run an exploit on the target system. In Kali Linux terminal spin up metasploit console with [msfconsole]. Using [search vsftpd] to search for the specific exploit, using the xploit with [use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor].       [show options] will show what is necessary to run the exploit. Set the host machine to the target with [set RHOST <ip of target>] and then enter [run] into the console.
5. Going to our machine running Nessus, run a new scan on the metasploitable vm.<br>

6. The scan results show the number of vulnerabilities, Severity rating, CVSS, VPR score, etc...<br>
