# Vulnerability Management

## Objective

A comprehensive vulnerability management project aimed at identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities for a client. Involving regular scanning, detailed analysis, and vulnerability prioritization, as well as implementing remediation. Findings and remediation efforts documented to improve client security posture.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using vulnerability scanning tools: Nessus.
- Evaluate the severity and potential impact of identified vulnerabilities, as well as prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk assessment criteria.
- Develop and implement remediation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.
- Create detailed reports on vulnerability findings and remediation.
- Effectually communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders.
- Understand system configurations and network architectures.
- Analyzing vulnerability scan results and investigating root causes of vulnerabilities while proposing effective solutions.
- Troubleshooting issues that arise as seen in the scan and subsequent research

### Tools Used

- Metasploit: To exploit vulnerabilities and validate remediation.
- Metasploitable: A deliberately vulnerable environment for testing.
- Nessus: To scan and identify vulnerabilities within the environment.

## Steps
1. After installing Nessus start a new scan and enter the name, a description, and your target (either a specific IP or a range/list of IP addresses in a file).<br>

2. When the scan completes check it's results. One can see the description of the vulnerabilities and a severity rating. Generate a report with the report button and choose "Complete list of vulberavilities by Host"<br>

3. Once comfortable with the contents of the report, install and run metasploit (framework installed in Kali) and metasploitable in the same network as your machine running Nessus.<br>
